## Other information

### Fights
- Fights can be started with </fight:1109210147991080961> <user> <character> [is spar?]
- Once the command is executed, a thread is created in the channel where the command was executed. 
- The thread contains all the information about the fight, like the moves that can be used and the health of the characters. 
- The thread will be updated every time a move is used.
- See </help:1108831716145123409> `fight` for more information about fighting.

### XP
- XP is gained by sending messages in channels where XP gain is enabled.
- Initially, a number between 12 and 24 is generated, and is then multiplied by the number of characters/10 in the message (capped at 50)
- So, if you have 1 character, you will get between 12 and 24 XP for each message you send and if you have 10 characters, you will get between 120 and 240 XP for each message you send.
- There is a cooldown of 30 seconds between each message you send, so you can't spam messages to gain XP.

- You can view your XP and level with </xp view:1108463180923011155>
- You can view the top 10 users by XP with </xp leaderboard:1108463180923011155>
